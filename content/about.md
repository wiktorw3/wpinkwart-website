## Welcome!
{{< image src="/me_wp.jpg" alt="Picture of me!" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px" >}}

Hey, I'm **Wiktor Pinkwart**. I grew up in Warsaw and have since called the Netherlands, Australia, and the UK my home at different times. Now back in Warsaw, but each of these experiences has uniquely contributed to my global perspective.

## Education:
---
My academic journey started with European Law at the Maastricht University. The highlight was my year-long student-exchange at ANU in Australia, where I interned at Polish Embassy and co-founded a student organization focused on blockchain and web3. My 2018 thesis on blockchain and GDPR, right when GDPR was taking effect, deepened my already growing passion for technology.

## Work:
---
My professional responsibilities concern navigating through Legal and Compliance challenges at the global fintech - **token.com**. Alongside this, I serve as Co-Chair of the Privacy Working Group at **INATBA**, a think tank advising EU regulators on blockchain regulations, including MiCA, TFR and AMLR.

## Music:
---
Outside of law and tech, music is my creative escape. I write and produce songs that you can find under the name **Departament Magii** on Spotify.

## What to expect?
---
In this space, I aim to share updates on:

* Technology Explorations
* Development of Tech Regulations
* My Music Ventures

**Keywords**: Law, Technology, Music
