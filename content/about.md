## Welcome!
{{< image src="/me_wp.jpg" alt="Picture of me!" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px" >}}

Hey, I'm **Wiktor Pinkwart**. I grew up in Warsaw and have since called the Netherlands, Australia, and the UK my home at different times. 

## Education
---
After finishing Batory High School in Warsaw, I moved to the Netherlands, where I studied European Law at Maastricht University. During my third year, I spent a year abroad at Australian National University.

I wrote my bachelor thesis on blockchain and GDPR, interned at the Polish Embassy in Australia, and co-founded a student organization focused on blockchain and web3.

## Work & Building
---
I began working in Compliance and Risk in London, advancing into roles such as MLRO, DPO, and Senior Compliance Officer, where I worked on scaling teams and building compliance systems in fintech environments.

Over time, I became increasingly involved on the technical side of products — working with data, analytics, SQL, and Python — and began building my own tools and side projects. This led me into technical product management, with a focus on systems that are both compliant and functional.

On the side, I contribute to open-source projects, take part in hackathons, and build **Wotum** — a product focused on making political data, voting records, and public decision-making easier to follow.

## Music
---
I also make music under the name **Departament Magii**.
