## [Welcome!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEq1Z0bjdwc)
{{< image src="/me_wp.jpg" alt="Picture of me!" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px" >}}

Hey, I'm **Wiktor Pinkwart**. Born in Warsaw, but with a global outlook \
My journey has taken me to live for more than 1 year in the Netherlands, Australia, the UK, and back to Poland, giving me a truly international perspective.

## Academic Background:
---
I studied European Law at Maastricht University. During a study exchange at ANU in Australia, I balanced interning at the Polish Embassy with co-founding a first student org diving into blockchain and web3. My thesis in 2018 tackled the tricky interplay between blockchain and the GDPR that has been taken effect at that time. That is when my passion for technology began to evolve.

## Professional Life:
---
As part of my work, I'm navigating through Legal and Compliance challenges at a global fintech startup, **token.com**. I'm also the Co-Chair of a Privacy Working Group at **INATBA** (think-tank) where we advise EU regulators on blockchain regulations, including MiCA, TFR and AMLR.

## Creative Side:
---
Outside of law and tech, I channel my creativity into music. I'm a song-writer and music producer, crafting tunes that I share on Spotify - *Departament Magii*. It's my way of blending analytical thinking with artistic expression. 

## What is in here?
---
In this space, I aim to share updates on:

* Technology Explorations
* Development of Tech Regulations
* My Music Ventures
